## Documentation

- [For this template](https://github.com/toams69/vuejs-template): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail
- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init toams69/vuejs-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The development ui server will run on port 5555 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.
